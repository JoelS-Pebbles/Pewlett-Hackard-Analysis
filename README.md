# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:
Needed to provide the number of retiring employees by title and to identify employees that are eligible for a mentorship program. Then write a summary of the analysis.

## Results:
* A third of all of the retirees are Senior Engineers. We need to find a way to replace these people
* Retirees that hold the position of Senior Staff are a close second for total retirees in that job position with a percentage of 31% of all retirees. 
* There are only two retirees with the title of Manager, this can be fixed easier than the rest of the job titles.

* From the mentorship_eligibility in the first ten rows, almost half of the employees have the title of Senior Staff. If this trend is true for the rest of the table, those positions will need to be filled out soon in the future. 

## Summary:
The first group of people that will reach retirement age are those were were born in Feb of 1952. There are 1,788 employees just for that month and year that will reach retirement age. This is the start of the silver tsunami. After that month for a continuation of years, there will be many people reaching reitrement age. 

There are enough retirement-ready employees to teach the next generation of PH employees. There are over 90,000 employees that were born between 1952-1955 who are ready for retirement. They can teach the employees that were bron between 1961-1965 how to be the seniors of the company. There are a little over 90,000 of this group as well. 

Another query that would be helpful to look at is the mentor titles. These are the titles that the people born in 1965 hold along with the count of how many hold each title. Below is the query and the output:
