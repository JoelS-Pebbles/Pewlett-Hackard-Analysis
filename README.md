# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:
Needed to provide the number of retiring employees by title and to identify employees that are eligible for a mentorship program. Then write a summary of the analysis.

## Results:
* A third of all of the retirees are Senior Engineers. We need to find a way to replace these people
* Retirees that hold the position of Senior Staff are a close second for total retirees in that job position with a percentage of 31% of all retirees. 
* There are only two retirees with the title of Manager, this can be fixed easier than the rest of the job titles.

* From the mentorship_eligibility in the first ten rows, almost half of the employees have the title of Senior Staff. If this trend is true for the rest of the table, those positions will need to be filled out soon in the future. 

## Summary:
The first group of people that will reach retirement age are those were were born in Feb of 1952. There are 1,788 employees just for that month and year that will reach retirement age. This is the start of the silver tsunami. After that month for a continuation of years, there will be many people reaching reitrement age. 

There are a little over 1,400 employees that are eligible for the mentorship eligibility program. There are enough of people that are closer to retiring that are able to mentor the employees that were born in 1965. 

A query that would be helpful to look at is the mentor titles. These are the titles that the people born in 1965 hold along with the count of how many hold each title. Below is the query and the output:

Another query that would be helpful is to look at a similar table for people that are filling in the shoes of the employees that are retiring. We will look at people that were born between 1956-1959. Below is the query and output:
