# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:
Needed to provide the number of retiring employees by title and to identify employees that are eligible for a mentorship program. Then write a summary of the analysis.

## Results:
* A third of all of the retirees are Senior Engineers. We need to find a way to replace these people
* Retirees that hold the position of Senior Staff are a close second for total retirees in that job position with a percentage of 31% of all retirees. 
* There are only two retirees with the title of Manager, this can be fixed easier than the rest of the job titles.
